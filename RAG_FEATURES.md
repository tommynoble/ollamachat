## 🎯 RAG Features

### 1. **Document Upload** 📄
- **Supported Formats:**
  - PDF files
  - Text files (.txt)
  - Markdown (.md)
  - JSON files
  - Python code (.py)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript (.js, .ts, .tsx, .jsx)

- **How it works:**
  - Click the **📎 Paperclip icon** in the chat
  - Select "Upload Document"
  - Choose a file from your computer
  - Document is automatically chunked and embedded

### 2. **Image Upload** 🖼️
- **Supported Formats:**
  - JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and other image formats

- **How it works:**
  - Click the **📎 Paperclip icon** in the chat
  - Select "Upload Image"
  - Choose an image file
  - Ready to use with vision-capable models

### 3. **Document Management** 📚
- **View Documents:**
  - Click **📎 Paperclip icon** to see all uploaded documents
  - Shows document name and chunk count
  - Scrollable list for many documents

- **Upload More:**
  - Use the "+ Upload Document" button in the popup
  - Add multiple documents for comprehensive context

### 4. **Vector Search & Embedding** 🔍
- **Technology:**
  - ChromaDB for vector storage
  - Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings
  - Semantic search for relevant context

- **How it works:**
  - Documents are split into chunks (500 words with 50-word overlap)
  - Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
  - When you ask a question, relevant chunks are found automatically
  - Context is provided to the model

### 5. **Smart Context Injection** 💡
- **Automatic:**
  - When you chat, the system searches for relevant document chunks
  - Top 3 most relevant chunks are included as context
  - Model uses this information to answer your questions

- **Benefits:**
  - More accurate answers based on your documents
  - No need to manually copy-paste information
  - Works with all models (llama2, deepseek-r1, etc.)

### Storage
- Documents stored in: `./chroma_db/`
- Embeddings cached for fast retrieval
- Persistent across sessions

### Performance

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Coming Soon:
- [ ] Delete individual documents from chat popup
- [ ] Document preview in popup
- [ ] Custom chunk size settings
- [ ] Multiple vector databases
- [ ] Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- [ ] Document metadata display
- [ ] Export chat with sources

### Current Limitations:
- Images are uploaded but not yet used in chat

## 📝 Tips & Tricks

1. **Better Results:**
   - Upload well-structured documents
   - Use clear, descriptive questions
   - Upload multiple related documents for comprehensive context

2. **Performance:**
   - Smaller documents embed faster
   - First upload takes longer (model initialization)
   - Subsequent uploads are much faster

3. **Organization:**
   - Upload documents before asking questions
   - Check the documents list to see what's available
   - Upload new documents anytime during conversation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Upload button shows "Uploading" but nothing happens**
- A: Cancel and try again. This is a UI state issue.

**Q: Documents don't appear in the list**
- A: Refresh the app or click the paperclip icon again.

**Q: Model doesn't use document context**
- A: Make sure documents are uploaded first. Search happens automatically.

**Q: Slow embedding on first upload**
- A: Normal! The embedding model loads on first use (~5-10 seconds).
